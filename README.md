# About 

`modelfactory` is an R package that takes care of the tedious task of comparing
model metrics and attributes. It's always a pain when I need to calculate, say,
an intercept, S.E., and 95% C.I. for several models and combine them into a dataframe.
This package aims to take care of that.

# Installation

You can install the development version of modelfactory with: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WillTirone/modelfactory")
```

# Usage

``` r
lm_1 = lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp, data = mtcars)
lm_2 = lm(mpg ~ hp + drat + wt, data = mtcars)
smelt(lm_1, lm_2)
```

# CRAN Submission

- remove unnecessary README stuff
- write a vignette 
- finish / verify that the functions have roxygen correct
- GH actions CI 
  
# Questions 
  - are imports correct? 

# Presentation Notes: 

## Interesting Stuff: 

- stats::confint and MASS::confint for glm's, see ?confint
- deviance / AIC are attributes of glm, but not lmer models!
  - difficult to write universal functions to get metrics etc.
  - this is why it's confusing to do this by hand
- dependencies are confusing
  
## Workflow: 

1. Edit one or more files below R/.
2. document() (if youâ€™ve made any changes that impact help files or NAMESPACE)
3. load_all()
4. Run some examples interactively.
5. test() (or test_active_file())
6. check()
