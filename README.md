# About 

Statisticians often want to compare different models fit to the same data set. However, this usually involves a lot of manual code to fish items out of summary() or plain model objects. 'modelfactory' offers the capability to pass multiple models in and get out metrics or coefficients for quick comparison with easy-to-remember syntax.

# Installation

You can install the package from CRAN with: 

``` r
install.packages("modelfactory")
```

Or, you can install the development version of modelfactory with: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WillTirone/modelfactory")
```

# Usage
