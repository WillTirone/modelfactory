Description: Statisticians often want to compare different models fit to the 
  same data set. However, this usually involves a lot of manual code to fish
  items out of summary() or model objects. 'modelfactory' offers the capability
  to pass multiple models in and get out metrics or coefficients for quick 
  comparison with easy-to-remember syntax.
